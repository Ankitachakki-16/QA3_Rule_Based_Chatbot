QA-3 Rule-Based Library Chatbot

This project is a rule-based chatbot developed for a library system.
The chatbot works using predefined rules, keywords, and regular expressions.

No Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or NLP libraries are used.
This project demonstrates how early AI systems and expert systems worked.

The chatbot can answer:
- Library timings
- Book issue process
- Book return rules
- Fine details
How It Works
User Input → Convert to Lowercase → Pattern Matching → Predefined Response

The chatbot uses IF–THEN rules:
If a keyword matches, then a fixed response is returned.

Difference Between Rule-Based System and NLU

Rule-Based Chatbot:

Uses keyword matching

Does not understand meaning

Does not learn

NLU-Based Systems:

Understand context and meaning

Use Machine Learning

Can handle complex sentences

This chatbot does NOT use Natural Language Understanding.

Limitations

Cannot understand complex sentences

Cannot handle spelling mistakes

Cannot learn new information

Works only with predefined rules
